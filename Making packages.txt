Use devtools and roxygen2 and install them from CRAN as install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2"))  # installations can be `c`ombined
library("devtools")
library("roxygen2")
Set working directory using the command setwd(parentDirectory) and create.package command with your package name then it will open the Rstudio separately. Add 
your function separately and add following things for dumentation in each file 
#' Name of function
#'
#' Purpose.
#' @param Input.
#' @return Output.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' Example

and save each file as .R. Setwd as the new package directly, write document(). It will create a new
file man having the documentation of functions if not then add documentation file manually. Now see package folder. It should have four things .R files, documentation as .Rmd files, 
Discription and namespace.
Change the directory to parent directory, install package, check package list.
Try to find out the documentation of one of the function, if you are able to do so you are pretty much done.
Test your functions file with known test cases.
